# ðŸ§® Python Sorting Analysis: TimSort vs PowerSort

This project was developed as part of the **Math 608 - Data Science course**. It explores the transition from **TimSort** to **PowerSort** in **Python 3.11**, explaining the underlying reasons, working mechanisms, and performance differences between the two sorting algorithms.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

To compare TimSort and PowerSort with a focus on:
- Algorithm structure and internal steps
- Edge-case performance
- Time and space efficiency
- Real-world relevance and application in Python

---

## ðŸ§  What Are TimSort and PowerSort?

### **TimSort**
- A hybrid sorting algorithm (Merge Sort + Insertion Sort)
- Default in Python from version 2.3 to 3.10
- Optimized for partially sorted data
- Stable sort

### **PowerSort**
- Introduced in Python 3.11
- Improved worst-case performance over TimSort
- More consistent in edge-case behavior
- Uses "power values" to determine merge order

---

## ðŸ”¬ Key Concepts Explained

- **Identifying Runs**: Sub-sequences of ordered elements
- **Merge Rules**: How runs are combined in each algorithm
- **Performance Analysis**: On average and worst-case datasets
- **Python 3.11 Transition**: Why the standard sorting method changed

## ðŸ“Š Slide Highlights

- Step-by-step simulation of sorting `[5, 7, 8, 4, 2, 1, 3, 10, 12, 11, 9, 15]`
- Diagrams of merge stacks in TimSort
- Power calculations and merge strategy in PowerSort
- Summary tables comparing speed, space, and reliability

ðŸ“ˆ Why Python Switched to PowerSort
More predictable behavior with irregular datasets

Lower memory usage

Tighter performance bounds

Alignment with CPythonâ€™s performance goals
